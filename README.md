# FastAPI ML Model Management and Serving
This project provides a FastAPI-based microservice for training, registering, and serving machine learning models. It allows saving the best-performing models, logging the training process, and exposing RESTful endpoints for predictions.

---

## Features
- Model Registry: Automatically saves and registers trained ML models with their performance metrics in model_registry.csv.
- Model Selection: Provides the ability to fetch and load the best model based on historical evaluation results.
- Logging: Records training and prediction activities in structured log files under the Logs/ directory.
- Modular Structure: Cleanly separated components in app/api/, app/core/, and DataAccess/ directories.
- Flexible Data Access: Organized datasets and models under DataAccess/ for easy management.
